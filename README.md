Mint Cargo's website

### About the Project
This project started as three different projects for our university.
- Web Applications
- Internet Technologies
- Data Base Applications
We saw the opportunity to integrate the three of them and make one big project that would help us apply all of what we have learned.

Mint Cargo is a logistics company that provides transport services worldwide as well as storage and customs. They are in the need of:
- A new website that presents their services.
- A rewards applications that allows their customers to see their loyalty point and place orders with them.
